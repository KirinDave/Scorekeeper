# Scorekeeper: A simple Clojure Webapp

Scorekeeper is an exploration on how to write webapps in Clojure. It is not
intended to be anything more than a relatively simple auto-didactic project 
that helps me grasp good style and learn which libraries are worth memorizing
and which are just running.

## Usage

Ultimately it'll just provide a .jar file that you'll invoke. Updates here
when I decide on the command line arguments.

## Installation

Use leiningen. lein deps, lein uberjar. Then GO. This is java, the one thing
it does indisputably right is simple deploys.
